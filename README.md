# Personal website

This is the repository of my personal academic webpage. It is developed with RStudio and blogdown using the Hugo academic theme from Wowchemy.

The site was created in a short time thanks to the following resources:

- The must-read book to start with is [blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)
- I have found this series of [video lessons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xbxXR_Iu5Y&list=PLpZT7JPM8_GbPiX4ibrP7ogl7GyEofZMj) extremely clear and straight to the point
- To conclude, this short [article](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/12/20/how-to-add-custom-domains-to-netlify-sites/) explains how to add a custom domain from Google to your Netlify website!
