Hi! I am an economist based in Berlin, Germany. I have 5+ years of coding experience in R in different academic projects. I am passionate about R in particular for macroeconomic modelling and macroeconomic data analysis. I am also interested in economic policy in Europe and occasionally I write articles on economic policy issues.
