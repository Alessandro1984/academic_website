Hi there! I am an Economist interested in Data Science. I am passionate about data and in particular macroeconomic data. I have 8+ years of experience in teaching introductory courses in Economics and Econometrics. I have also worked on academic projects aimed at creating interactive contents for students. My goal is to combine my knowledge of Macroeconomics with my interest in Data Science. Occasionally I write articles on economic policy issues in Italy and Europe.
