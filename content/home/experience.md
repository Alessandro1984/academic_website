      I have worked mainly on two projects, [MGWK](https://www.alessandrobramucci.com/project/mgwk/), short for the German *Modelltheoretische Grundlagen wirtschaftspolitischer Kontroversen*, and [WIPOSIM](https://www.alessandrobramucci.com/project/wiposim/) - The economic policy simulator. Goal of the two project was to teach Macroeconomics in an interactive and engaging way using some simple simulations. Both projects have been developed entirely in R/RStudio and numerous other packages (shiny, plotly, bookdown, etc.).
      
      My responsibilities included:
      * Programming of the simulators in R Shiny
      * Writing the explanatory texts for the simulations
      * Editorial work on the text using the bookdown package for the HTML and LaTex version
