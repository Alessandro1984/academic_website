# WIPOSIM â€“ The economic policy online simulator

*Together with Eckhard Hein, Achim Truger, Franz Prante and Till van Treeck*

Goal of WIPOSIM was the extension of texts and simulations developed in the previous project MGWK. Here we focused on current economic policy problems and challenges of developed economies in three selected areas of interest: inequalities and income distribution, fiscal policy and public debt, ecology and macroeconomics. My contribution focused on the first two thematic areas.

**Fiscal policy and public debt:**

In the text, [*Introduction to fiscal policy and public debt*](https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course.netlify.app/), we introduce the government budget identity and derive the factors determining the evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio. We then discuss the question of debt sustainability and illustrate the role of the primary balance. To conclude, we discuss the main European fiscal rule from a critical perspective. With a series of simple applications we simulate the concepts explained in the text.

* [Evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio under different assumptions](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_shiny_1/)  
* [Evolution of the debt-to-GDP ratio with nominal interest rate and inflation](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_inflation/)  
* [Sustainability boundary, sustainability area and the dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_shiny_sustainability/)   
* [Required primary balance to bring debt to target in a predefined number of years years](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/debt_simulation_primary_balance_2/)
      
In a second text, [*Fiscal policy and the debt-to-GDP ratio. A seemingly counterintuitive effect?*](https://wiposim-fiscalpolicy-course2.netlify.app/), using some simple Keynesian arithmetic we show the circumstances under which fiscal policy migth have a counterintuitive effect on the debt ratio.

* [Deficit spending and the debt-to-GDP ratio - a seemingly counterintuitive effect? The effect in the short run](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/course2_app3/)
* [Deficit spending and the debt-to-GDP ratio - a seemingly counterintuitive effect? The effect in the long run](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/course2_app4/)

**Inequalities and income distribution:**

- Extending Piketty's *r>g* model with different income groups
    * Access the app [here](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/distribution_piketty_households/)
- Effects of the gender wage gap in a simple post-Keynesian / Kaleckian macroeconomic model. 
    * Access the introductory text [here](https://wiposim-genderwagegap.netlify.app/)
    * And access the app showing the model's goods market equilibrium with a gender wage gap [here](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/wiposim_gender/)
