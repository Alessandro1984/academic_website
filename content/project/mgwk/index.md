*Together with Eckhard Hein, Achim Truger and Franz Prante*

Aim of the project was to develop a didactic tool to interactively present macroeconomic theories from a multiparadigmatic perspective. Our interactive online textbook discusses basic macroeconomic concepts at the bachelor level. In the interactive illustrations, parameters and variables of the model can be changed by the users. In a series of interactive scenarios, the users take control of various economic policy instruments, reacting to economic problems with appropriate policy measures. The models for the closed economy are presented from a New Keynesian and a post-Keynesian perspective. By changing individual assumptions, a transition between the model worlds becomes possible. The results of the project contributed to the dissemination of pluralism in economic education and teaching.
