# Model-theoretic Foundations of Controversies in Economic Policy (MGWK)

*Together with Eckhard Hein, Achim Truger and Franz Prante*

Goal of the project MGWK (short for the German *Modelltheoretische Grundlagen wirtschaftspolitischer Kontroversen*) was to develop a didactic tool to teach macroeconomic interactively and from a pluralist perspective. Text and simulations are available in English and German.

You can access the English version of the book here:

- [Introduction to Macroeconomics: Pluralist and Interactive](https://eng.mgwk.de/)

And here the German version:

- [Einführung in die Makroökonomik: plural und interaktiv](https://www.mgwk.de/)

In a series of interactive illustrations, the users take control of various economic policy instruments, reacting to economic problems using the appropriate policy measures. With the following link, you can get a quick preview of the applications developed in the project. The remaining apps and scenarios are accessible in the online book in the relative chapters.

- [Scenario: Aggregate demand shock and policy reaction of the user](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/scenario1_eng/)
- [Complete model: Aggregate demand/supply shock and endogenous policy reaction](https://mgwk.shinyapps.io/full_model1_eng/)
